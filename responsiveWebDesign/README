These files make up a record of when I learned fundamentals of Web Design using HTML and CSS! This is the first topic I explored within freecodecamp.

see the catPhotoApp files for basic HTML. I really like how basic and almost retro this page looks! Reference this for including hyperlinks, and other things like bolding text or setting up text section elements.

see the cafeMenu files for basic CSS. my favorite part of this project was the insertion of visuals (small images and a large background image).

see the cssColorMarkers files for more in depth exploration of CSS colors and manipulations like gradients and shadows.

see the registrationForm files for a bare-bones setup of a form that users can fill out. the color scheme of this form is really pleasant and night-mode friendly!

see the surveyForm files for a more independently-designed data collection form (I chose a bike-centric theme, but this is how to set up something to collect any information from users or customers).

see the rothkoPainting files for an overview of the "CSS Box Model." my favorite parts of this project are the blurring of colors, rounding of edges, and shape transformations.

see the flexboxPhotoGallery files for a very nice photo gallery template, that rounds the edges of photos and ensures proper alignment of boxes with window resizing.
